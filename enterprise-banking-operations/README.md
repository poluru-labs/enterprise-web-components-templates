# Aurevia · Poluru National

Core banking operations workspace for **Poluru National**. Light theme, brand `#0B3D5C`, hash routing. Titles use **Source Serif 4**; body copy uses **Source Sans 3**.

The canvas starts **full width**. Use the menu control (or `⌘\`) to open the sidebar; hide it again to return to full width.

```

Opens at [http://localhost:5191](http://localhost:5191). Preview build at port **4191**.

## Clearing-rail header

Aurevia uses a **clearing-rail header** — a cool navy canvas (`#EAF2F6`) with **Received / Posted / Held / Settled** rail cells and a gold **liquidity** chip (`$2.4B available`). Right side: payment search, ⌘K command palette, Release payment, inbox, and profile. The Aurevia brand mark sits on navy `#0B3D5C`. Implemented as the `<aurevia-header>` custom element with open shadow DOM.

This is intentionally distinct from Beacon’s claims-stage rail, Sentinel’s queue strip, and Atlas’s purchase pipeline.

Cards use full 1px borders. There are no gradients and no left or top accent bars.

```

## Pages

Overview, Payments (and payment detail), Accounts, Exceptions, Screening, Clearing, Settings, **Search** (`#/search`).

Jump with `⌘K` (command palette) or the header search (routes to `#/search`).

## Tests

Vitest + jsdom unit tests cover format/search/status/router helpers and the `content-card` / `aurevia-header` custom elements:

```bash
npm test
```
